# Differential Dataflow For Mere Mortals

## Differential Dataflow

Differential Dataflow is a technique for incrementally maintaining views and query results.

Consider a music application. A music app may normalize its data and store it across a number of tables.

- Track table
- Playlist table
- Artist table
- Album table
- Playlist_Track junction table
- Track_Artist junction table

When viewing a playlist we'll need to join all of these tables together to get the whole picture.

```sql
SELECT
  playlist.track_num,
  track.name,
  track.duration,
  group_array(artist.name),
  album.name,
  album.art_handle
FROM playlist
  JOIN playlist_track ON playlist_track.playlist_id = playlist.id,
  JOIN track ON track = playlist_track.track_id
  JOIN album ON album = track.album_id
  JOIN track_artist ON track_artist.track_id = track.id
  JOIN artist ON artist.id = track_artist.artist_id
WHERE playlist.id = 1
```

That's a very expensive operation for what will be a common query in a music application. Ideally we could de-normalize this data into a single table and query _that_ instead.

```sql
SELECT track_num, name, duration, artist_names, album_name, art_handle FROM playlist_denormalized WHERE id = 1;
```

There's a problem with de-normalizing, however. After de-normalizing there will be multiple copies of the same data to keep in sync.
This problem can be made more tractable by forcing all de-normalized forms of the data to be read-only. Doing this means that the normalized form
becomes the single source of truth for the data.

The problem created by this solution, however, is that the de-normalized forms must somehow be updated whenever a write occurs to one of it's input tables.

> How can we efficiently update the de-normalized form when a write happens to one of its input tables?

This is the problem of incremental view maintenance and differential dataflow is one solution to this problem.

## For Mere Mortals

Knowing the problem and a solution to that problem, can the solution be made accessible to average developers?

There is no lack of literature on differential dataflow:
- https://timelydataflow.github.io/differential-dataflow/introduction.html
- https://materialize.com/blog/differential-from-scratch/
- https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.16684

But it is rather inaccessible, even though differential dataflow it based on some simple ideas.

Those ideas are:
- The Z-Set
- Linear and non-linear operations
- Operator Graph
- Operator Memory

## The Z-Set

> A `Z-Set` is the same thing as a set except that each element contains a magnitude indicating the number of times that element should be present. In addition, duplicate elements (same value and magnitude) are allowed as well as negative magnitudes.

Before getting into how this is helpful for incremental view maintenance, it'll be useful to understand this definition a bit more.

Capturing the english definition as a type definition:
```ts
// A ZSet is an array of tuples. The first element of the tuple
// can be anything. The second element is an integer representing its weight.
type ZSet = Vec<(any, int)>
```

Some example z-sets that fit the definition follow.


1. A set where each element is present exactly once

```python
a = [(A, 1), (B, 1), (C, 1)]
```

2. Another set where each element is present once. This set is equal to the first.

```python
a = [(A, 2), (A, -1), (B, 2), (B, -1), (C, 2), (C, -1)]
```

Normalizing or consolidating a z-set allows comparing z-sets and is a matter of summing the weights of identical elements and removing those with a weight of 0.

In the examples, (2) becomes (1) after summing weights.

### Application to Incremental View maintenance

A `Z-Set` is useful for incremental view maintenance since its weights allow tracking how a set is changing over time.

Given a stream of updates to a `Z-Set`, the weights tell:

- If an item was added (positive weight)
- If an item was removed (negative weight)
- How many times the item was added or removed (sum of and magnitude of weight for that item)
