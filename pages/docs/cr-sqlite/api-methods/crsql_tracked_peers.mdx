# crsql_tracked_peers

`crsql_tracked_peers` is a table that can be used for tracking what updates have been received from peers or sent to peers.

This table is useful for authors of custom network / syncing layers.

## Table Structure

```sql
CREATE TABLE crsql_tracked_peers(
  [site_id] BLOB NOT NULL,
  [version] INTEGER NOT NULL,
  [tag] INTEGER,
  [event] INTEGER,
  PRIMARY KEY ([site_id], [tag], [event])
) STRICT;
```

1. **site_id** - the unique id of the peer
2. **version** - falls into two categories:
    For receive events: The clock value we last _received_ from that peer
    For send events: The clock value we last _sent_ that peer. I.e., For sends, this is _our_ db's clock not the peer's.
3. **tag** - used to differentiate sync sets. Tag is set to `0` for whole database syncs. Inserts into `crsql_changes` where tag is set to `-1` will not create tracking events. If you're only syncing subsets of the database then this tag represents the subset you're syncing, such as an id of a "root node" of some sub-graph. Coming soon -- see [[docs/replicated-subgraphs]]
4. **event** - 0 for receive events, 1 for send events. Values below 1000 are reserved for `crsqlite`

## Tag Values

- `0` - WHOLE_DATABASE
- `-1` - reserved
- All other values are open for use by clients.

## Event Values

- `0` - RECEIVE
- `1` - SEND
- [2-1000] - reserved
- All other values are open for use by clients. Prefer `tag` over `event` if you need to track many version for a given peer.
