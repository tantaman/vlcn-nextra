# Partial CRR Sync

Partial CRR sync is useful for cases where:

1. You need row level security
2. You have mutli-tenant database where data from many users exists in the same tables / crrs.
3. You want to sync only a subset of the data from the backend to the frontend due to dataset size.

While it is possible to implement partial sync with the primitives available to you today, **it is not advised and not supported**. At a later date we will be releasing primitives specifically intended to support partial sync, row level security, and large scale multi-tenant databases.
